# ArcheryGame

This is a simple command line game I've build to practice object oriented programming in C++.
The game uses kinematic equations to calculate the range of a projectile based on launch angle.
All game related methods(calculations and game statistics) are declared in game.h.
All user interaction methods are declared in ui.h
All method descriptions can be found in the header files.
